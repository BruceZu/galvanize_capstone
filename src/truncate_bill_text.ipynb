Congress finds the following: (1) The United States and Mexico have benefitted from a bilateral, mutually beneficial partnership focused on advancing the economic interests of both countries.

(3) On January 18, 2018, the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs at the Department of State stated, ``Our exchange programs build enduring relationships and networks to advance U.S. national interests and foreign policy goals . . .

R. 54 To designate the outstation of the Department of Veterans Affairs in North Ogden, Utah, as the Major Brent Taylor Vet Center Outstation. _______________________________________________________________________ IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES January 3, 2019 Mr. Bishop of Utah (for himself, Mr. Stewart, and Mr. Curtis) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs _______________________________________________________________________ A BILL To designate the outstation of the Department of Veterans Affairs in North Ogden, Utah, as the Major Brent Taylor Vet Center Outstation. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Major Brent Taylor began his military service following the attacks of September 11, 2001. He joined the Army National Guard in 2003, three days after his engagement to his wife, Jennie. Five of his brothers would eventually serve in the Armed Forces following the deadly attacks. (2) During his time in the Army National Guard, Major Taylor distinguished himself in service to the United States and the State of Utah. He received a commission as a second lieutenant from the Brigham Young University Reserve Officer Training Corps in 2006, while graduating as a member of the National Society of Collegiate Scholars. (3) During his impressive career with the Utah National Guard, Major Taylor distinguished himself in multiple specialties, including Intelligence and Military Police. One of his earliest assignments included analyzing foreign language documents in support of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He also led document exploitation efforts in multiple European and South American languages for a variety of intelligence community customers. Major Taylor also managed a team that assessed security vulnerabilities at high-profile facilities across the United States, all while maintaining a successful private sector career in Utah. (4) Major Taylor was continuously ready to take up his Nation's call to arms and deployed four times in support of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. His deployed duties varied from Platoon Leader and Combat Advisor to Chief of Staff to the Special Operations Advisory Group, responsible for leading a joint task force advising and assisting an elite Afghan special operations unit. (5) Throughout his deployments, Major Taylor distinguished himself on several occasions, earning a multitude of awards including the Bronze Star. The citation credits Major Taylor's ability to think calmly and decisively with keeping his subordinates safe while traversing 600,000 miles of roads in Iraq, laden with improvised explosive devices (hereinafter, ``IED'') and ripe for ambush. (6) During one particularly harrowing mission, Major Taylor's vehicle was struck by an IED. While he survived the attack, the wounds he received earned him the Purple Heart. (7) Major Taylor's amazing record of service was not limited to the battlefield. In 2010, he served as a member of the North Ogden City Council and, in 2013, Major Taylor was elected mayor. His steadfast leadership led to the city being recognized as ``Business Friendly'' by the Governor of Utah, and as one of the safest, freest cities in the United States by several organizations. His initiatives included improvements to public works and infrastructure, attracting businesses to the area, developing a local community center, and increasing transparency. His action led his constituents to reelect Major Taylor in 2017. (8) In 2018, Major Taylor placed himself on a leave of absence from his mayoral duties in order to deploy to Afghanistan, explaining to his constituents, ``Service is what leadership is all about''. (9) While serving in Afghanistan, a dear colleague, Afghani Lieutenant Kefayatullah, was killed shortly before the Afghan elections. Major Taylor wrote, ``The strong turnout at that election, despite the attacks and challenges, was a success for the long-suffering people of Afghanistan, and for the cause of human freedom. I am proud of the brave Afghan and U.S. soldiers I serve with. Many American, NATO and Afghan troops have died to make moments like this election possible.''. He also extolled the American public to embrace its civic duty, stating, ``I hope everyone back home exercises their precious right to vote. And that whether the Republicans or Democrats win, that we all remember that we have far more as Americans that unites us than divides us.''. (10) Tragically, on Saturday, November 3rd, 2018, Major Taylor was killed in an attack in Afghanistan. He was survived by his wife, Jennie, and his seven children, Megan, Lincoln, Alex, Jacob, Ellie, Jonathan, and Caroline. (11) The impression that Major Taylor left was indelible. An Afghan officer who had served with Major Taylor, penned a letter to his wife, stating, ``Your husband taught me to love my wife Hamida as an equal and treat my children as treasured gifts, to be a better father, to be a better husband, and to be a better man.''. That officer further commented that, ``He died on our soil but he died for the success of freedom and democracy in both of our countries.''. (12) It is only well and fitting that, as a tribute to this man's amazing life, Congress name a facility in honor of Major Taylor's shining example of service and sacrifice. SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF MAJOR BRENT TAYLOR VET CENTER OUTSTATION IN NORTH OGDEN, UTAH. (a) Designation.--The outstation of the Department of Veterans Affairs located at 2357 North 400 East Washington Boulevard, North Ogden, Utah, shall, after the date of the enactment of this Act, be known and designated as the ``Major Brent Taylor Vet Center Outstation''.

(a) Findings.--The Congress finds that-- (1) approximately 4,000,000 Africans and their descendants were enslaved in the United States and colonies that became the United States from 1619 to 1865; (2) the institution of slavery was constitutionally and statutorily sanctioned by the Government of the United States from 1789 through 1865; (3) the slavery that flourished in the United States constituted an immoral and inhumane deprivation of Africans' life, liberty, African citizenship rights, and cultural heritage, and denied them the fruits of their own labor; (4) a preponderance of scholarly, legal, community evidentiary documentation and popular culture markers constitute the basis for inquiry into the on-going effects of the institution of slavery and its legacy of persistent systemic structures of discrimination on living African- Americans and society in the United States; and (5) following the abolition of slavery the United States Government, at the Federal, State, and local level, continued to perpetuate, condone and often profit from practices that continued to brutalize and disadvantage African-Americans, including share cropping, convict leasing, Jim Crow, redlining, unequal education, and disproportionate treatment at the hands of the criminal justice system; and (6) as a result of the historic and continued discrimination, African-Americans continue to suffer debilitating economic, educational, and health hardships including but not limited to having nearly 1,000,000 black people incarcerated; an unemployment rate more than twice the current white unemployment rate; and an average of less than \\\\1/16\\\\ of the wealth of white families, a disparity which has worsened, not improved over time. (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a commission to study and develop Reparation proposals for African-Americans as a result of-- (1) the institution of slavery, including both the Trans- Atlantic and the domestic ``trade'' which existed from 1565 in colonial Florida and from 1619 through 1865 within the other colonies that became the United States, and which included the Federal and State governments which constitutionally and statutorily supported the institution of slavery; (2) the de jure and de facto discrimination against freed slaves and their descendants from the end of the Civil War to the present, including economic, political, educational, and social discrimination; (3) the lingering negative effects of the institution of slavery and the discrimination described in paragraphs (1) and (2) on living African-Americans and on society in the United States; (4) the manner in which textual and digital instructional resources and technologies are being used to deny the inhumanity of slavery and the crime against humanity of people of African descent in the United States; (5) the role of Northern complicity in the Southern based institution of slavery; (6) the direct benefits to societal institutions, public and private, including higher education, corporations, religious and associational; (7) and thus, recommend appropriate ways to educate the American public of the Commission's findings; (8) and thus, recommend appropriate remedies in consideration of the Commission's findings on the matters described in paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6); and (9) submit to the Congress the results of such examination, together with such recommendations.

Congress makes the following findings: (1) According to the report issued by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in 2018 entitled ``Sexual Harassment of Women: Climate, Culture, and Consequences in Academic Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine''-- (A) sexual harassment is pervasive in institutions of higher education; (B) the most common type of sexual harassment is gender harassment, which includes verbal and nonverbal behaviors that convey insulting, hostile, and degrading attitudes about members of one gender; (C) 58 percent of individuals in the academic workplace experience sexual harassment, the second highest rate when compared to the military, the private sector, and Federal, State, and local government; (D) women who are members of racial or ethnic minority groups are more likely to experience sexual harassment and to feel unsafe at work than White women, White men, or men who are members of such groups; (E) the training for each individual who has a doctor of philosophy in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields is estimated to cost approximately $500,000; and (F) attrition of an individual so trained results in a loss of talent and money. (2) Sexual harassment undermines career advancement for women. (3) According to a 2017 study led by Dr. Kathryn Clancy at the University of Illinois, among astronomers and planetary scientists, 18 percent of women who are members of racial or ethnic minority groups and 12 percent of White women skipped professional events because they did not feel safe attending. (4) Many women report leaving employment at institutions of higher education due to sexual harassment. (5) Research shows the majority of individuals do not formally report experiences of sexual harassment due to a justified fear of retaliation or other negative professional or personal consequences. (6) Reporting procedures with respect to such harassment are inconsistent among Federal science agencies and have varying degrees of accessibility. (7) There is not adequate communication among Federal science agencies and between such agencies and grantees regarding reports of sexual harassment, which has resulted in harassers receiving Federal funding after moving to a different institution.

R. 35 To amend section 249 of title 18, United States Code, to specify lynching as a hate crime act. _______________________________________________________________________ IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES January 3, 2019 Mr. Rush introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary _______________________________________________________________________ A BILL To amend section 249 of title 18, United States Code, to specify lynching as a hate crime act. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Emmett Till Antilynching Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) In the 20th century lynching occurred mostly in southern States by White southerners against Black southerners. (2) In 1892, the Tuskegee Institute began to record statistics of lynchings and reported that 4,742 reported lynchings had taken place by 1968, of which 3,445 of the victims were Black. (3) Most of the lynchings that occurred in the South were mass moblike lynchings. (4) Mass moblike lynchings were barbaric by nature characterized by members of the mob, mostly White southerners, shooting, burning, and mutilating the victim's body, alive. (5) In ``Anatomy of a Lynching: The Killing of Claude Neal'', community papers readily advertised mob lynchings, as evidenced by a Florida local paper headline: ``Florida to Burn Negro at Stake: Sex Criminal Seized from Brewton Jail, Will be Mutilated, Set Afire in Extra-Legal Vengeance for Deed.'' (6) Civil rights groups documented and presented Congress evidence of vigilante moblike lynchings. (7) Evidence by NAACP investigator Howard Kester documented the extreme brutality of these lynchings. An excerpt from ``Anatomy of a Lynching'' further illustrates this point: ``After taking the nigger to the woods about four miles from Greenwood, they cut off his penis. He was made to eat it. Then they cut off his testicles and made him eat them and say he liked it.'' (8) Many civil rights groups, notably the Anti-Lynching Crusaders, also known as the ALC, operating under the umbrella of the NAACP, made numerous requests to Congress to make lynching a Federal crime. (9) Congressman George Henry White, an African American, introduced the first Federal antilynching bill and subsequently nearly 200 antilynching bills were introduced in the Congress during the first half of the 20th century. (10) Between 1890 and 1952, seven Presidents petitioned Congress to end lynching. (11) Between 1920 and 1940, the House of Representatives passed three strong antilynching measures, of which Congress came closest to enacting antilynching legislation sponsored by Congressman Leonidas C. Dyer in 1922. (12) On all three occasions, opponents of antilynching legislation, argued States' rights and used the filibuster, or the threat of it, to block the Senate from voting on the measures. (13) The enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 was the closest Congress ever came in the post-Reconstruction era to enacting antilynching legislation. (14) In 2005, the Senate passed a resolution, sponsored by Senators Mary Landrieu and George Allen, apologizing for the Senate's failure to enact antilynching legislation as a Federal crime, with Senator Landrieu saying, ``There may be no other injustice in American history for which the Senate so uniquely bears responsibility.'' (15) To heal past and present racial injustice, Congress must make lynching a Federal crime so our Nation can begin reconciliation. SEC. 3. SPECIFYING LYNCHING AS A HATE CRIME ACT. Section 249(a) of title 18, United States Code, is amended-- (1) by redesignating paragraph (4) as paragraph (5); and (2) by inserting after paragraph (3) the following: ``(4) Offenses involving lynching.--Whoever, whether or not acting under color of law, willfully, acting as part of any collection of people, assembled for the purpose and with the intention of committing an act of violence upon any person, causes death to any person, shall be imprisoned for any term of years or for life, fined under this title, or both.''. <all>\", 'date': '2019-01-09'}\n",

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS. (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Trade with China Enforcement Act''. (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act is as follows: Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents. Sec. 2. Sense of Congress. Sec. 3. Statement of policy. TITLE I--SAFEGUARDS AGAINST FOREIGN INFLUENCE IN UNITED STATES NATIONAL AND ECONOMIC SECURITY BY THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA Sec. 101. Establishment of list of certain products receiving support from Government of People's Republic of China pursuant to Made in China 2025 policy. Sec. 102. Prohibition on export to People's Republic of China of national security sensitive technology and intellectual property. Sec. 103.

Repeal of reduced withholding rates for residents of China. Sec. 203. Taxation of obligations of the United States held by the Government of the People's Republic of China. SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. It is the Sense of Congress that-- (1) since joining the World Trade Organization in 2001, the People's Republic of China has offered the United States a contradictory bargain, which promised openness in the global trade order, but through state mercantilism delivered a severely imbalanced trading relationship; (2) it was erroneous for the United States Government to have ignored the contradictions and risks of free trade with the People's Republic of China on the assumption that the People's Republic of China would liberalize economically and politically; (3) benefiting enormously from a more open global economy to drive its own industries, the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Communist Party of the People's Republic of China have only tightened their grip on power, brutally suppressing dissent at home and pursuing policies abroad that are a far cry from being a responsible global stakeholder; (4) malevolent economic behavior by persons in the People's Republic of China is made clear by the theft of intellectual property from the United States, as Chinese theft of United States intellectual property alone costs the United States nearly $600,000,000,000 annually, according to the United States Trade Representative; (5) stealing United States intellectual property advances the Made in China 2025 initiative of the Government of the People's Republic of China to eventually dominate global exports in 10 critical sectors, namely artificial intelligence and next-generation information technology, robotics, new- energy vehicles, biotechnology, energy and power generation, aerospace, high-tech shipping, advanced railway, new materials, and agricultural machinery, among others; (6) the targets of the Made in China 2025 initiative reveal the goal of the People's Republic of China for the near-total displacement of advanced manufacturing in the United States; and (7) the United States Government should act to strengthen the position of the United States in its policy toward the People's Republic of China in order to create a more balanced economic relationship by safeguarding strategic assets from Chinese influence, reducing Chinese involvement in the United States economy, and encouraging United States companies to produce domestically, instead of in the People's Republic of China. SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. It is the policy of the United States-- (1) to impose restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States in strategic industries targeted by the Made in China 2025 initiative set forth by the Government of the People's Republic of China; (2) to tax Chinese investment in the United States due to its negative effect on the United States trade deficit and wages of workers in the United States; (3) to increase the cost of transnational production operations in the People's Republic of China in a manner consistent with the economic cost of the risk of loss of unique access by the United States to intellectual property, technology, and industrial base; and (4) to support democratization in and the human rights of the people of Hong Kong, including the findings and declarations set forth under section 2 of the United States- Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (22 U.S.C. 5701).

SEC. 104. PROHIBITION ON USE OF CERTAIN TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES OR EQUIPMENT. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) In its 2011 ``Annual Report to Congress on Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China'', the Department of Defense stated, ``China's defense industry has benefited from integration with a rapidly expanding civilian economy and science and technology sector, particularly elements that have access to foreign technology. Progress within individual defense sectors appears linked to the relative integration of each, through China's civilian economy, into the global production and R&D chain . . . Information technology companies in particular, including Huawei, Datang, and Zhongxing, maintain close ties to the PLA.''. (2) In a 2011 report titled ``The National Security Implications of Investments and Products from the People's Republic of China in the Telecommunications Sector'', the United States China Economic and Security Review Commission stated that ``[n]ational security concerns have accompanied the dramatic growth of China's telecom sector. . . . Additionally, large Chinese companies--particularly those `national champions' prominent in China's `going out' strategy of overseas expansion--are directly subject to direction by the Chinese Communist Party, to include support for PRC state policies and goals.''. (3) The Commission further stated in its report that ``[f]rom this point of view, the clear economic benefits of foreign investment in the U.S. must be weighed against the potential security concerns related to infrastructure components coming under the control of foreign entities. This seems particularly applicable in the telecommunications industry, as Chinese companies continue systematically to acquire significant holdings in prominent global and U.S. telecommunications and information technology companies.''. (4) In its 2011 Annual Report to Congress, the United States China Economic and Security Review Commission stated that ``[t]he extent of the state's control of the Chinese economy is difficult to quantify. . . . There is also a category of companies that, though claiming to be private, are subject to state influence. Such companies are often in new markets with no established SOE leaders and enjoy favorable government policies that support their development while posing obstacles to foreign competition. Examples include Chinese telecoms giant Huawei and such automotive companies as battery maker BYD and vehicle manufacturers Geely and Chery.''. (5) In the bipartisan ``Investigative Report on the United States National Security Issues Posed by Chinese Telecommunication Companies Huawei and ZTE'' released in 2012 by the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives, it was recommended that ``U.S. government systems, particularly sensitive systems, should not include Huawei or ZTE equipment, including in component parts. Similarly, government contractors--particularly those working on contracts for sensitive U.S. programs--should exclude ZTE or Huawei equipment in their systems.''. (6) General Michael Hayden, who served as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency and Director of the National Security Agency, stated in July 2013 that Huawei had ``shared with the Chinese state intimate and extensive knowledge of foreign telecommunications systems it is involved with''. (7) The Federal Bureau of Investigation, in a February 2015 Counterintelligence Strategy Partnership Intelligence Note stated that, ``[w]ith the expanded use of Huawei Technologies Inc. equipment and services in U.S. telecommunications service provider networks, the Chinese Government's potential access to U.S. business communications is dramatically increasing. Chinese Government-supported telecommunications equipment on U.S. networks may be exploited through Chinese cyber activity, with China's intelligence services operating as an advanced persistent threat to U.S. networks.''. (8) The Federal Bureau of Investigation further stated in its February 2015 counterintelligence note that ``China makes no secret that its cyber warfare strategy is predicated on controlling global communications network infrastructure''. (9) At a hearing before the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives on September 30, 2015, Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work, responding to a question about the use of Huawei telecommunications equipment, stated, ``In the Office of the Secretary of Defense, absolutely not. And I know of no other--I don't believe we operate in the Pentagon, any [Huawei] systems in the Pentagon.''. (10) At that hearing, the Commander of the United States Cyber Command, Admiral Mike Rogers, responding to a question about why such Huawei telecommunications equipment is not used, stated, ``As we look at supply chain and we look at potential vulnerabilities within the system, that it is a risk we felt was unacceptable.''. (11) In March 2017, ZTE Corporation pled guilty to conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act by illegally shipping United States-origin items to Iran, paying the United States Government a penalty of $892,360,064 for activity between January 2010 and January 2016. (12) The Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of the Treasury issued a subpoena to Huawei as part of a Federal investigation of alleged violations of trade restrictions on Cuba, Iran, and Sudan. (b) Prohibition on Agency Use or Procurement.--The head of an agency may not procure or obtain, may not extend or renew a contract to procure or obtain, and may not enter into a contract (or extend or renew a contract) with an entity that uses, or contracts with any other entity that uses, any equipment, system, or service that uses covered telecommunications equipment or services as a substantial or essential component of any system, or as critical technology as part of any system. (c) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the United States Trade Representative, shall submit to Congress a report on sales by the Government of the People's Republic of China of covered telecommunications equipment or services through partial ownership or any other methods. (d) Definitions.--In this section: (1) Agency.--The term ``agency'' has the meaning given that term in section 551 of title 5, United States Code. (2) Covered telecommunications equipment or services.--The term ``covered telecommunications equipment or services'' means any of the following: (A) Telecommunications equipment produced by Huawei Technologies Company, ZTE Corporation, or any other Chinese telecom entity identified by the Director of National Intelligence, the Secretary of Defense, or the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as a security concern (or any subsidiary or affiliate of any such entity). (B) Telecommunications services provided by such entities or using such equipment. (C) Telecommunications equipment or services produced or provided by an entity that the head of the relevant agency reasonably believes to be an entity owned or controlled by, or otherwise connected to, the Government of the People's Republic of China.

(a) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States-- (1) to reduce the import of finished goods from the People's Republic of China relating to the Made in China 2025 plan set forth by the Government of the People's Republic of China; and (2) to encourage allies of the United States to reduce the import of finished goods from the People's Republic of China relating to the Made in China 2025 plan. (b) Inclusion of Made in China 2025 Products in Definition of Countervailable Subsidy.--Paragraph (5) of section 771 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1677) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``(G) Treatment of certain chinese merchandise.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, if a person presents evidence in a petition filed under section 702(b) that merchandise covered by the petition is manufactured or produced in, or exported from, the People's Republic of China and included in the most recent list required under section 183 of the Trade Act of 1974, determined in consultation with the United States Trade Representative, the administrating authority shall determine that a countervailable subsidy is being provided with respect to that merchandise.''. (c) Inclusion of Made in China 2025 Products in Definition of Material Injury.--Paragraph (7)(F) of such section is amended by adding at the end the following: ``(iv) Treatment of certain chinese merchandise.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, if a petition filed under section 702(b) alleges that an industry in the United States is materially injured or threatened with material injury or that the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded by reason of imports of merchandise manufactured or produced in, or exported from, the People's Republic of China and included in the most recent list required under section 183 of the Trade Act of 1974, determined in consultation with the United States Trade Representative, the Commission shall determine that material injury or such a threat exists.''.
